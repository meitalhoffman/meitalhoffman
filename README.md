# Hi, I'm Meital ðŸ‘‹
## Data Analyst, Urban Scientist, Curious Person

- I'm passionate about using data to answerÂ questions and provide actionable insights.
- My goal for fall of 2024 is to develop and publish projects exploring urban questions using publicly available data. Stay tuned for the first project, which will be shared on this GitHub profile!
- I'm currently working as a data analyst/sustainability and resilience planner at AECOM, where I lead data analysis and project management across a wide range of climate, sustainability, energy,Â and master planning projects.
- Currently, I use Python, Excel, SQL, and ArcGIS to deliver internal and external data insight; however, I also am proficient in Tableau.
- I completed my Masters in City Planning at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT DUSP) in May 2022, with a focus in urban analytics.
- In 2020, I earned a Bachelors degree from MIT in Urban Planning and Computer Science, with a focus in data analytics.
- Besides geeking out over interesting data insights, I enjoy making pottery, fiber arts, yoga, biking, hiking, concerts, and cooking.
